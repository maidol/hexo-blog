# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Commands

This repository is a Hexo static blog (Node.js). Note that `node_modules` is not tracked in git; run `npm install` first if dependencies are missing.

- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
- **Start local preview server**: `npx hexo server` (or `npx hexo s`, accessible at `http://localhost:4000`)
- **Generate static website**: `npm run build` (outputs to `public/`)
- **Clean cache and public output**: `npx hexo clean`
- **Create a new post**: `npx hexo new "post-title"` (creates Markdown file in `source/_posts/`)
- **Create a new standalone page**: `npx hexo new page "page-name"`
- **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: `npm run deploy` (pushes to `https://github.com/maidol/maidol.github.io.git` master branch)
- **Full build & deploy pipeline**: `npx hexo clean && npm run build && npm run deploy`

*Note: No test suite or linter is configured in `package.json`. The `build` and `deploy` scripts use `scripts/hexo-cli.js` because Hexo 3's generator is incompatible with modern Node.js stream auto-destruction.*

## Architecture & Key Structure

- **`_config.yml`**: Root site configuration (site metadata, permalinks `:year/:month/:day/:title/`, active theme `yilia`, Git deployment target).
- **`source/_posts/`**: Markdown source posts with frontmatter (`title`, `date`, `tags`).
- **`scaffolds/`**: Template scaffolds used by `hexo new` (`post.md`, `page.md`, `draft.md`).
- **`themes/yilia/`**: Currently active theme.
  - `themes/yilia/_config.yml`: Theme-specific settings (menus, social subnavs, comments, friend links).
  - `themes/yilia/layout/`: EJS layout templates.
  - `themes/yilia/source/`: Static assets (Stylus stylesheets, client-side JS, images).
- **`themes/landscape/`**: Hexo default theme (inactive fallback).
- **`package.json`**: Hexo 3.2.x core and plugins (generators, renderers, git deployer).

## Code graph (structural questions go through the graph first)

This repository is folded into the **`hexo-blog`** plane, re-folded on every
commit, and served by the `drsg-watch` MCP tools on `http://127.0.0.1:46441/mcp`. It
models: Class, Module, Package, Stylesheet, Manifest, Var. For its current size and the commit it is synced up to, ask
`describe_plane` or run `/home/mark/.drsg-memory/tools/codegraph.sh status --dir /data/projects/maidol/hexo-blog` — no count is written down
here, because a count in a document is wrong one commit later.

**Every call must pass `plane: "hexo-blog"`.** The tools default to `startup`,
which is an empty plane, and its answer — `no symbol matches` — is
indistinguishable from the graph genuinely not knowing. In the first audit of
this setup, plane addressing accounted for 6 of the 8 empty answers; only 2
were real gaps.

**The check on an answer is the graph's own symbol key.** A structural claim
must quote the full key the graph returned — `crate::module::Symbol`,
`github.com/acme/example/pkg.Type.Method` — not just a `file:line`, because grep
prints `file:line` too and so a rule written on it cannot catch its own
violation.

**The trigger is in the answer, not in the question.** The moment a reply
contains a quantified structural claim — "only X callers", "nothing uses it",
"nothing else is affected", "these are the places to change" — that claim has
to come from the graph, however casual the question sounded.

| Question | Verb |
|---|---|
| who calls X / all of X at once | `context` (start here) |
| what does changing X affect | `impact` |
| how does A reach B | `trace` |
| where is X, what is its signature | `describe` |
| give me the source of X | `snippet` |
| what is in the plane at all | `describe_plane`, `cypher` |
| text the graph does not model | `grep` (searches the watched tree) |

**A change question is not answered until `impact` has run.** Asking what
changing, renaming or deleting X reaches is a different question from who calls
X, and `context` cannot answer it: it walks one hop. Any reply about the reach
of a change must quote `impact`, which groups what it found by distance and
counts each group — a caller list does not have that shape, so pasting one is a
visible substitution, not an answer. `impact` finding nothing past distance 1 is
itself the answer; say so. It counts recorded edges only and says as much in its
own output — carry that caveat with the number, it is a lower bound. The same
rule holds for `trace`: a claim that A reaches B quotes the path `trace`
returned, hop by hop.

Expect to break this one. Over the first month of this setup `context` was
called 46 times, `impact` once, and `trace` never — every question about blast
radius was answered by the verb that only sees one hop, and none of those
answers looked wrong at the time.

**Ask with a symbol name, not a description.** `context` resolves a string in
three passes (exact key, then `::name`/`.name` suffix, then case-insensitive
substring). Naming a file sends the answer to `Read`; naming a symbol goes to
the graph. The third pass is the boundary: a descriptive word works only if it
is a substring of some symbol's name, so `plugin` resolves and a phrase in prose
— or in a language the code is not written in — does not. That is `grep`'s job,
and the answer has to say so.

**An ambiguous name is not a failure, but the candidate list is capped at 20 and
is not ranked by relevance.** Past about 20 candidates, do not pick from what is
shown — narrow and ask again, because the right symbol may be in the part that
was folded away. `Type::method` is the narrowing that usually lands in one call.
With 2–10 candidates, `describe` each and choose from the signatures: a function
returning another crate's type is usually a wrapper, and running `impact` on the
wrapper reports a strictly smaller blast radius than the thing it delegates to.

**Raise `impact`'s depth until a group comes back empty.** It walks 3 hops by
default, and cutting off where propagation has not stopped yields the first
three hops rather than the reach; two symbols measured at different depths are
not comparable. The empty group is the evidence that the answer is complete.

**The graph will also tell you it does not know**, and that is worth more than
a guess: the `UnresolvedRef` nodes are exactly where the parsers gave up (there
are thousands — `describe_plane` counts them), and cross-language edges are
generally broken. Comments (`//`), string
literals, and files no plugin claims (`.md`, `.sh`, CI config) are not modelled
at all. Use `grep` there and **say that the answer came from grep** — an empty
graph result is a finding to report, never a reason to fall back to impressions.

Daemon: `/home/mark/.drsg-memory/tools/codegraph.sh {start|stop|restart|status|rules} --dir /data/projects/maidol/hexo-blog`. One per
repository; the address and token both live in `.mcp.json`, so never mint a new
token — that invalidates every client config `drsg init` wrote.
